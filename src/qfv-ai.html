                                                it'll check if there is a ranged ally nearby and ensure some distance from them as well to create a more entertaining fight. Other than that, the base behaviour is quite similar.

                                                When it comes to A.I optimization there are two major points which I focused on, the "brain" aspect (how the A.I processes it's information and senses), and the pathing. I'm splitting the brain aspect in this section, the pathing in the section below.
                                            </p>

                                                When it comes to processing the information that the A.I is recieving, optimization at it's root is minimizing the amount of checks in any one time and situation. In other words keeping the A.I as simple as possible with as much percieved depth for the
                                                smallest process. One way which I optimized the A.I's "thought process" was by streamlining the 3 distinct modes of the A.I's. If the A.I was in the default Patrol / Guard mode, it would sit cob-webbed until
                                                it recieved an awaken call from the player or another hostile such as another A.I who was of an opposing faction. Then it would engage into Attack mode. Through creating a cob-webbed version of the A.I it
                                                allows in-active A.I to be far less expensive than they would be otherwise.

                                                When it comes to Pathing, at least with the Enviroment Query System (EQS), it's all about filtering the pathing to reduce the amount of pathing tries and potential calculations on "desirability" of any given point. That being said outside of the EQS,
                                                making it run less times in an increment of time will likewise decrease the expense of the pathing.

For example, if a Skeleton Swordsman saw the player, it would call out to it's neighbours near it and alert them of the
                                                intruder and where it last saw the player. Therefore the Skeletons would go investigate the last seen location with their own random variance in pathing. Overall creating the illusion of a communicative
                                                and united enemy front who actually investigate the area around where the player was last spotted.

                                                In order to facilitate this we were provided with a base script for automating the building procedure in Unreal. Past the base script I further expanded it in and tied it into our version control, backup
