                                                Early on in the project we had to decide on which engine we were going to use. As we had two programmers we both set off to prototype in our respective preferred engines. I began in Unreal 4 and rapidly prototyped a series of features for our puzzle game.

                                                Since the game began as a 2.5D isometric game, I had to develop a few camera systems to accomodate for the player's movement and visibiliy of our puzzle mechanics.

                                                In order to expedite the level design and prototyping, I created a Level Editor which would allow us to create levels at a much faster rate and increase performance by making use of Unreal's hierarchical instanced static mesh system. Effectively hi-jacking
                                                the system Unreal created for foliage to allow as much grandeur as we desired in our level.

                                                As the game continued to progress, so did the Level Editor. It began as a very simple concept with basic shapes and a basic U.I but soon progress to proper rooms with a series of rulesets for placing of walls and pillars.

Soon afterwards, the system was expanded to include the game interactables and other design features like elevation and room connections.

                                                Early in the project I was advised by a few Mentors that the collaboration with the Sound Design collaborators could prove jarring as it would be our first time working with a completely external team which wasn't comprised of game design students. Therefore
                                                I set out to make the collaboration as seemless as possible. After checking out the Sound Designer's pipeline and the integration of Wwise I created an audio tool that allowed the Sound Designers to post
                                                the wwise events from within Unreal to test whether their Wwise implementation was correctly working.

                                                One of the major risks when it comes to puzzle games is the Quality Assurance as no two people will approach the same puzzle the same way. In order to midigate this risk we had to quantify the experience of those who played the game. Therefore datahooks
                                                were in order. For Shift I ended up creating a datahooks for all sorts of necessary data such as room completion time, which player finished the room first, overall game time, and a few more. The data provided
                                                from the datahooks allowed us to adjust our game length for our end target of pitch & play.

                                                When we decided to make our game a co-op game we had to both learn how to do networking and which way we would be able to maximize our efforts for the desired outcome. Little did we know that Unreal already had a rather robust Steam tie-in that made the
                                                process far less painful.

                                                As Shift was a VFS Final Project we were required to use Wwise, which we hadn't touched at all upto the point when we started working with the Sound Design collaborators. At the start it was a whirlwind of new information and knowledge but it soon fell
                                                into order. It taught me the invaluability of communication as we all at first stumbled until we found our stride.

                                                When it came to Shift, as we had many hands on the project we had to sort out some manner of testing things at a rapid pace and being able to ensure that our builds would be readily avaliable and accessable for our own team and even Mentors and Instructors.
                                                In order to facilitate this we were provided with a base script for automating the building procedure in Unreal. Past the base script I further expanded it in and tied it into our version control, backup
                                                management. Through which I had to re-write the script from scratch several times.
